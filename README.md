# Customer-Sentiment-Analysis
This is a data science project to analyse the sentiments of customers from Amazon Alexa Reviews data.
# Introduction
* Natural language processing can be used to build predictive models to perform sentiment analysis on social media posts and reviews and predict if customers are happy or not.
* Natural language processors work by converting words into numbers and training a machine learning model to make predictions.
* That way, you can automatically know if your customers are happy or not without manually going through massive number of tweets or reviews!
